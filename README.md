# ECE1724F1-Team-Project

## Motivation
The motivation behind choosing a Personal Finance Tracker as our team project stems from the desire to create a light-weight yet practical tool that can genuinely improve users' financial literacy and management skills. We recognized a gap in the Rust ecosystem for a user-friendly command-line utility that helps individuals track their income and expenses effectively.

By creating this utility, we aim to assist users in budgeting, tracking expenses, setting and achieving financial goals, and managing debt, all while providing insights and trend visualizations. Rust's strengths in data security and concurrency make it an ideal choice for a finance tool, ensuring that user information remains safe and processing is efficient compared to applications built in other languages. 

Moreover, this project offers a unique opportunity for us to build an application from scratch, encompassing both frontend UI and backend server components, along with a database. We will delve into various Rust libraries, gaining hands-on experience that fosters a holistic understanding of full-stack developmentâ€”from UI/UX design to server-side logic and database management. Managing this project from inception to deployment will not only enhance our technical skills but also teach us essential lessons in planning, designing, implementing, testing, and ultimately delivering robust software solutions.
